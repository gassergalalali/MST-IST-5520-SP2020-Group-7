    "Finding a solution for the affordable housing crisis is a challenge facing the United States (US). Aproximately, 66 percent of renters nationwide can not afford the price of purchasing a house (Sisson et al. 2019). Moreover, compared to the growth in wages, the prices of houses are increasing in a double rate (Sisson et al. 2019). This issue is more pronounced in single-family houses, which is one of the key real-estate markets in the US. As opposed to a multi-family residential dwellings, single-family houses are stand-alone houses; that is, free-standing residential buildings. This critical problem is affecting the business operations of many construction companies in the US. These companies include 'contrators' who are responsible for building the houses, real-estate developers who sell the houses, and buyers who purchase them."

    "Single-family homes are common in rural and suburban and even some urban areas across the US. They are most common in low-density, high-income regions. In fact, there are about 95 million single family homes in the US as of 2019 (Moran 2019). For decades, land-use regulation across the US has emphasized single-family houses on large lots which priced many people out of the quintessential American dream: home ownership (Parker and Lewis 2020). As such, the goal of this project is to study the real-estate market behavior. In order to acheive that, the team will investigate methods to predict the sale price, completion time, and to identify many other patterns in the real-estate market of single-family houses in the US.
